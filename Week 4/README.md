In this last assignment, we try to predict stock prices based off a Fama-Mcbeth type of regression. The inputs would be inverse price, lagged months of prices, and market cap. We find that stock prices are very hard to predict and achieve a really low R^2 for the assignment. We also see the plots to analyze the nature of the data. Afterwards, we explore other inputs that will significantly improve the predictive power of the linear regression.
