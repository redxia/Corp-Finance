In this week, we explore the effectos on E/P of a company based on lagged change in percent earnings. The idea is that when earnings changes, so should the E/P especially because it is in the
numerator of this expression. We expect when the lagged change effect should be positive with E/P since if change is positive, we should be earning more. We examine S & P 500 stocks from 2008 to 2013.

Most earnings to price is positive because the S&P 500 is mostly matured firms, and changes in
earnings could be negative. Thus, we find it is hard to predict E/P based off of earnings.
